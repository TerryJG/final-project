            <h2 class="font-primary">Outline</h2>
            <p class="font-secondary">For CSD 1100, HTML & JavaScript, my final project is a personal portfolio website,
                where I showcase my real creative works in graphic design and video editing. This website will
                demonstrate my overall abilities in creating HTML structures, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity
                with JavaScript learnt throughout the course as well as using additional resources from W3Schools and
                YouTube.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-primary">Website Structure</h2>
            <p class="font-secondary">In learning how to work with industry-standard frameworks such as React.js, my
                folder structure of my project is modeled after a React project. The "public" folder consists of all
                static content such as images and videos, as well as icons for buttons. The "src" folder, abbrivated
                from "source", includes all the CSS and JS files used for the portfolio website.
            </p>
            <p class="font-secondary">The website will feature five pages:
                <a href="index.html">Homepage,</a>
                <a href="projects.html">Projects,</a>
                <a href="resume.html">About Me,</a>
                <a href="contact.html">Contact,</a>
                and
                <a href="credits.html">Credits,</a>
                with each page serving a specific purpose within the site's framework. All pages, except the
                landing page, will include a navigation bar positioned at the top, containing buttons linked to various
                sections. Additionally, a minimal site navigation bar will be present at the bottom of every page,
                visually showing the user the current location within the site.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary">The <a href="index.html">Homepage</a> will be the landing page when a user visits
                the site. It is styled as a set of columns with featured images and videos. Near the top of the landing
                page will be a set of buttons acting as navigation links to different pages of the website using the
                <code class="html-tag">&lt;a href=""&gt;</code> element.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary"> The <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page is designed similarly to the
                Homepage, showcasing all the images and videos incorporated into the portfolio website. At the top of
                the Projects page, users will find a group of categories presented as buttons, created using the
                <code class="html-tag">&lt;button&gt;</code> element. Each category contains a selection of images and
                videos. When a
                user clicks on one of these category buttons, the JavaScript logic will filter out any images and videos
                not belonging to that category. For example, there are two buttons labeled <b>"Graphic Design"</b> and
                <b>"Video Editing"</b>. If you click on <b>"Graphic Design"</b>, the JavaScript will scan all the
                elements within the <code class="html-tag">&lt;main&gt;</code> container holding the images and videos.
                It will hide any
                elements that do not have a class called <b>"image-item"</b>, which will leave only those that do.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary">The <a href="resume.html">About Me</a> page is a text-based resume, utilizing a
                flex-column layout to organize information under sections like Education, Experience, Skills, and
                Outreach. A side navigation bar is included exclusively in this page that allows users to navigate
                between sections using the <code class="html-tag">&lt;a href=""&gt;</code> element.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary">The <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page is a form box featuring input fields
                for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Message, allowing users to reach out and connect.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary">Lastly, the <a href="credits.html">Credits</a> page will outline all my resources
                as well as my outline for the website.
            </p>


            <h2 class="font-primary">Styling</h2>
            <p class="font-secondary">Throughout the website's design process, my primary focus was on modularity. This
                meant that CSS files can be reused across the project and reduce repetition in code. Files such as the
                <code class="css-tag">preloader.css</code>, <code class="css-tag">scrollbar.css</code>, <code
                    class="css-tag">fonts.css</code>, and column layouts are styled using this approach, which makes the
                overall look more consistent across pages. Additionally, this gives the added benefit of modifying a
                particular CSS file, and the changes can automatically be reflected throughout the website.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary">For styling, the portfolio website uses a mix of Flexbox and Tables using plain
                CSS. Flexbox ensures a consistent look and reliably arrange elements in either rows or columns. Tables
                provide a structured format for organizing and aligning information, used in the <a
                    href="resume.html">About Me</a> page.
            </p>

            <p class="font-secondary">Each page is fully responsive and designed for multiple screen resolutions using
                Media Queries. Although CSS frameworks like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a
                    href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> could make website responsiveness
                more efficient, I wanted to both learn and demonstrate how responsiveness works without any
                abstractions.
